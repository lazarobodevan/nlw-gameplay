# nlw-gameplay

This is a cross platform mobile app developed during Next Level Week (NLW), an event created by RocketSeat.
In this app, you can book your gameplays and invite friends, once the infos come from your discord server/guild.

# ðŸš€ Installing
<npm install />
  
# Running
First, create a file called .env with this base structure:
< REDIRECT_URI=
SCOPE=
RESPONSE_TYPE=
CLIENT_ID=
CDN_IMAGE=/>

and fill it. Do not add "" nor ;
Just the raw info :)

Then, execute the command
<expo start/>

and you're done!
